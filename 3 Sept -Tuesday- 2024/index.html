                <ol>
                    <li class="list-heading">JavaScript</li>
                    <p>JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. A majority of the web’s most popular
                        sites,
                        from Facebook and Twitter to Gmail and YouTube, rely on JavaScript to create interactive web
                        pages
                        and dynamically display content to users. Due to its flexibility, JavaScript has many
                        possible
                        applications. Although it’s primarily a front-end language run on the browser, it can be
                        used on the
                        server-side through Node.js to build scalable network applications. Node.js is compatible
                        with
                        Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X, and Windows. Through the use of specialized frameworks, like React
                        Mobile
                        and Electron, JavaScript can also be used for mobile app and desktop software development.
                        Because
                        JavaScript has a forgiving, flexible syntax and works across all major browsers, it is also
                        one of
                        the friendliest programming languages for beginners. At Fullstack Academy, we chose to focus
                        our
                        curriculum on Javascript back in 2013. Today, as a leader in the tech education space,
                        Fullstack
                        Academy continues to primarily teach full stack JavaScript across all our coding bootcamps
                        for
                        2024—including our Software Engineering Immersive and Grace Hopper Program for women and
                        nonbinary
                        coders.</p>
                    <li class="list-heading">Python</li>
                    <p>Python is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language of any on this list. It’s often
                        said
                        that Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost English-like, which makes it a popular
                        choice
                        for beginners. Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, powerful
                        option when
                        choosing the best programming language for your use case. If you’re interested in back-end
                        web
                        development, for example, then the open-source Django framework, written in Python, is
                        popular, easy
                        to learn, and feature-rich. Django has been used in the development of some popular sites
                        like
                        Mozilla, Instagram, and Spotify. Python also has packages such as NumPy and SciPy that are
                        commonly
                        used in the fields of scientific computing, mathematics, and engineering. Other Python
                        libraries
                        such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenCV are used to build programs in data
                        science,
                        machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. Python's science and data
                        applications make
                        it a great choice for the academically inclined.</p>
                    <li class="list-heading">SQL</li>
                    <p>Along with Python, SQL programming is essential to efficiently using data in web
                        applications. Unlike
                        other coding languages on our list, though, SQL specifically enables the storage,
                        extraction, and
                        manipulation of data within an existing database. As the primary database programming
                        language, SQL
                        has its own markup that must be learned to query a database effectively. Programmers
                        interested in
                        working with apps that utilize intensive-use databases like social media platforms, payment
                        processors, and music libraries should consider learning SQL. For prospective data
                        professionals,
                        SQL familiarity is usually a must-have skill for roles like database administrator, data
                        analyst,
                        and QA engineer.

                    <li class="list-heading">TypeScript</li>
                    <p>Over the last several years, TypeScript has grown in popularity, with close to 40% of
                        developers
                        using the programming language, according to Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer's Survey.
                        According to
                        the TypeScript website, several well-known companies are utilizing the programming language,
                        including Google, Airbnb, and Slack. Once you learn JavaScript, TypeScript is simple to
                        learn. The
                        open-source programming language builds on JavaScript and works in any environment that runs
                        JavaScript. One of the biggest benefits of TypeScript is its ability to help speed up
                        development by
                        finding errors before the JavaScript code is even run.
